## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `cuibaponline.github.io` (exactly this name!)
3. **Visibility:** Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code

From `/home/duy/projects/cuibaponline.github.io`, run:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace with your repo URL from GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/cuibaponline/cuibaponline.github.io.git

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Animal Learning Game monorepo setup"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

**Note:** GitHub might use `main` as default branch. If so:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under "Source":
   - Select branch: `gh-pages`
   - Select folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

**Wait 2-5 minutes** for the first deployment to complete.

### Step 4: Visit Your Site!

Your apps will be available at:
- **Landing Page:** https://cuibaponline.github.io/
- **Animal Learning:** https://cuibaponline.github.io/animal-learning/
